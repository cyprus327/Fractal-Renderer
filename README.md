## Keybinds: 
### For all other than Mandelbulb:
- WASD to move
- Q to zoom out
- E to zoom in
- Z to decrease max iterations
- X to increase max iterations
### For Mandelbulb:
- WASD to rotate
- Q to zoom out
- E to zoom in
### Additional keybinds for Julia
- C to decrease the real constant
- V to increase the real constant
- B to decrease the imaginary constant
- N to increase the imaginary constant
### Additional keybinds for Multibrot
- C to decrease the power
- V to increase the power
